            <h2>Mini-Biography</h2>
            <br>
            <p>According to one account by Wong herself, she was born around 1974 to a wealthy Chinese-Vietnamese family in the Chợ Lớn district of Saigon in the final months of the Vietnam War. In the aftermath of the Fall of Saigon, persecution of the Hoa became commonplace due to class division. When she was three years old, Wong's family sold off what remained of their assets to human traffickers in order to escape to the United States, but they were ultimately cheated and arrived with no money to survive on. However, the validity of this account is questionable as Wong would later remark on this story as being fabricated to test Leon S. Kennedy's gullibility.</p>
