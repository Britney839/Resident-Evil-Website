            <h2>Mini-Biography</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Claire grew up with her older brother Chris after their parents died; with this event, the two developed a very close bond. When Chris joined the U.S. Air Force, she was introduced to his new friend, Barry Burton, and he became a close family friend. After high school, Claire attended university, where she developed her interest in motorcycle customisation, owning two motorcycles herself.[7] Claire also specialized in lockpicking, becoming an expert with skill. After Chris moved to Raccoon City with Burton to serve in Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), Claire would occasionally visit her brother to learn hand-to-hand combat and firearms training. He also gave Claire a golden lighter and his S.T.A.R.S. knife.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In August 1998, Chris left for Europe to investigate Umbrella.[11] After weeks of not hearing from her brother, Claire left her college in late September for Raccoon City to find out where he was. She stopped at a diner in the northern parts of the city, having not noticed the violence in the city, and was confronted by the murderous chef. Upon leaving she was saved by Leon S. Kennedy, who decided they drive to the police station for safety. While approaching the station, they were separated by a fiery accident, and fought their way out to it. Leon and Claire soon discovered the station had collapsed due to the outbreak of the t-Virus, being that the only unzombified police officers were the injured Lt. Marvin Branagh, Elliot Edward, and Police Chief Brian Irons.</p>
