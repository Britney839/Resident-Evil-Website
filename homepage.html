        <p>Raccoon City is a small, remote industrialized city located in the US mid-west. It was destroyed during the t-virus outbreak of 1998. The city sat at the foot of the Arklay mountains to the north, on a confluence between three rivers: the Marble; Circular and Aimes.</p>

                <h2>The Early Timeline</h2>
                <br>
                <p>While the Resident Evil games don't begin, chronologically, until the late 90s, the events leading up to that first night in the Spencer Mansion actually bring us all the way back to the discovery of the Progenitor virus in the 1960s.
                    The three key figures most important to the early Resident Evil timeline are virologists Edward Ashford, James Marcus, and Oswell E. Spencer. The three men cultivated the Progenitor virus from a rare West African flower called Stairway to the Sun, eventually co-founding Umbrella Pharmaceuticals in 1968 to disguise the true nature of their endeavors - using their research to develop biological weapons.</p>

        <p>The Raccoon City incident is the first major biological outbreak in the series, and it sets the stage for the entire Resident Evil timeline. Resident Evil 2 introduces Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, and it explores the duo's struggle to survive in a city overrun by zombies and other nightmarish creatures. Leon arrives in the city for his first day as a police officer, only to find out his entire precinct has been brutally wiped out. Meanwhile, Claire is on the hunt for her brother, Chris Redfield.</p>

            <p>Each and every survivor is special in their own way and has went through it all to get to where they are.</p>
