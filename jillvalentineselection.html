            <h2>Mini-Biography</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In the early 1990s, Valentine served in the United States Army and got the attention of recruiters for Delta Force, the nation's primary counter-terrorism unit. Although the unit does not enlist women, Valentine was allowed to take part in the six-month intensive Operator Training Course, where she excelled in bomb disposal & lock-picking and was known for her delicate and nimble though precise dexterity, as well as resilience, courage, and discernment amid danger. This experience made Valentine one of the only women in the world with Delta Force training, capable of dismantling even the most intricate explosives in a matter of minutes. During her time in the US Army, she met fellow soldier Forest Speyer who she would later work with more closely. She left the military in pursuit of experiences that made her feel alive, as well as to assuage her sense of justice and intolerance for those who harm innocent people. Some time in 1996, Valentine was recruited by Albert Wesker for the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), an elite unit of Raccoon Police Department (RPD) that relied on military veterans and weapons-trained scientists to solve serious crimes in Raccoon City.</p>
