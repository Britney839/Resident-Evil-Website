            <h2>Mini-Biography</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Kennedy is known to have suffered a traumatic childhood due to his family's connections to crime. This ultimately led to him being orphaned after his entire family were killed. Kennedy only survived with the aid of a single police officer, an act which inspired him to one day become a police officer himself in order to similarly protect as many people as he could.[10] Upon graduating from the police academy at the age of 21, Kennedy requested assignment to work for the Raccoon Police Department. His reason was interest in the widely publicized but unsolved bizarre murder cases taking place in and around the Arklay Mountains.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kennedy had no travel plans or apartment in Raccoon City, and in the hasty departure, broke up with his girlfriend. Stopping at a motel for the night, he passed out from heavy drinking and woke up on the afternoon on September 29, a Tuesday. Kennedy continued driving into the city hungover, now late for reporting in to the station. Driving through Arklay County, he passed through the highway blockade erected by the United States Army and Army National Guard on the night of September 29, which had fallen due to the chaos within the city.</p>
