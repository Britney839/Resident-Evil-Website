        <br>
        <p>The Resident Evil Prime Universe starts with Resident Evil 0, the prequel to Resident Evil. Shortly before the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team infiltrates the Spencer Mansion, Bravo Team member Rebecca Chambers has to face her own nightmare. Just like the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team, Bravo is investigating a string of cannibalistic murders in the Arklay Mountains, which eventually leads Rebecca to investigate the mysteriously stalled Ecliptic Express. Rebecca teams up with escaped convict Billy Coen as the pair discover that all the train's passengers have been turned into zombies. When the train stops at an Umbrella Corporation facility, Rebecca discovers the project of the company's co-founder Dr. James Marcus, who unearthed a progenitor virus and decided to combine it with leech DNA. Resident Evil 0 also provides a bit more context on Albert Wesker's betrayal of S.T.A.R.S. and the history of the Umbrella Corporation's creation of bioweapons.</p>

        <br>
        <p>However, it's in the Spencer Mansion of Resident Evil where things really start to pick up. Here, the S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team is investigating the disappearance of Bravo, with Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine at the heart of everything. In the mansion and connecting research facility, the team learns about the illegal experiments conducted by the Umbrella Corporation, wherein humans and other creatures were exposed to the T-Virus, turning them into zombies and undead creatures. While exploring the Umbrella laboratory, the S.T.A.R.S. members also discover a terrifying bio-organic weapon named Tyrant. The leader of Alpha Team, Albert Wesker, reveals his role as a double agent alongside his plan to wipe out S.T.A.R.S. using said Tyrant. In the end, Jill and Chris defeat both Wesker and Tyrant, and they manage to escape the mansion after activating its self-destruct protocol.</p>

        <p>Continuing from the snippet mentioned on the homepage, throughout the course of the game, it's revealed that the Raccoon City Police Chief was hiding evidence of Umbrella's experiments at the Spencer Mansion and its outskirts, and Leon meets a woman named Ada Wong, who claims to be an FBI agent investigating the company. Both characters are relentlessly stalked by Mr. X, a more powerful version of the Tyrant. While Ada and Leon infiltrate Umbrella's underground laboratory, Claire meets a young girl named Sherry Birkin, who is the daughter of William Birkin (the creator of the G-Virus.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Resident Evil 3 starts one day before the events of Resident Evil 2, during which Jill Valentine has taken up residence in Raccoon City while investigating Umbrella. As the city falls apart, Jill and fellow S.T.A.R.S. member Brad Vickers are hunted by Nemesis, a new bioweapon created by Umbrella. While escaping the monster, Jill runs into Carlos Olivera, a member of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service - a group designed to help save critical targets in the case of an outbreak. She meets the other members of the UBCS, including Nicholai Ginovaef, in the subway.
            Jill, who could be brought back in Resident Evil 9, learns of subway cars that the team has set up to evacuate civilians; she leaves to reactivate the subway's power system. Carlos and another member named Tyrell head to the Raccoon City Police department to find Dr. Nathaniel Bard, who may have a cure for the T-Virus.</p>

        <p class="headers">Resident Evil 4 (2004)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Resident Evil 4 takes place six years later in 2004. Leon Kennedy, who is now a member of the Secret Service, is sent to a remote village in Spain to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley Graham. A cult known as Los Iluminados is suspected of holding Ashley, and upon his arrival in the village, Leon is immediately attacked by its inhabitants. The village leader, Bitores MÃ©ndez, manages to overpower Leon and inject him with Las Plagas - a parasite that controls the mind of its host and turns them into a zombie-like being.
            Leon finds himself imprisoned with RE4 remake's more complex Luis Sera, who is a former Umbrella biologist and previous ally of Los Iluminados; the two work together to escape and then go their separate ways. Through a vision, Leon learns the true plan of Los Iluminados from its leader, Osmund Saddler. The cult plans to use the Plagas they infected Ashley with to force her to inject the President of the United States with a sample, thus granting them control over him.</p>
